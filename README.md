## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🧬 `Machine-Learning-Breast-Cancer`
A classification project focused on breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning models involving preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

### 🧠 `Machine-Learning`
A general-purpose folder for foundational ML models, possibly including regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation on standard datasets.

### 💼 `Portfolio-Optimisation`
Applies machine learning and mathematical optimisation techniques (e.g. mean-variance optimisation, Monte Carlo simulation, Sharpe ratio maximisation) to financial portfolios. This includes time series data, risk assessment, and asset allocation strategies.

### ⚽ `Sports-Project`
Sports analytics project — possibly involving performance prediction, player stats analysis, match outcome classification, or visualisation. Likely uses real-world datasets or scraped data.
